            <h1 class="center"> A Brief Introduction on HTML and CSS </h1> 
            <h2 class="center">You have entered my Technology Page.</h2> 
            <p><a class="uppercase" href="http://www.html.am/">HTML</a> or Hypertext Markup Language is a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages. The logo is the orange five below. That's the exact definition but that may be confusing to most people who are not familiar with the coding world.  
               HTML is a language just like English but it's a type of computer language. There are many computer languages but HTML is the most used. The web sites you look at like Youtube or Google were probably built by HTML. Just like English has verbs, nouns, and other parts of speech that make it up, HTML has tags, elements, classes, and other parts of code that make a web site. 
               For example, one anchor tag is used to link page to page. That allows you to jump to another part of a site on the Internet. </p> 
            <p><a class="uppercase" href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/">CSS</a> or Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. The logo for CSS is the blue three located in the image below. CSS is connected with HTML since they both interact with one another. CSS is what makes your web site stylish and funky. For example, you can make text center or add borders to words. Bordering, padding, and margins are what surrounds text.  
                The dashed lines around the introduction is one example of bordering, padding, and margins at work. If you are interested in coding, click the image below.</p> 
            <!--I know the center tag can be done on CSS but I rather have it on my HTML.-->  
            <!--This image is connected to a link that leads to a web site that teaches HTML and CSS.-->
